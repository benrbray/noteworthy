# Noteworthy ([https://noteworthy.ink/](https://noteworthy.ink/))

A free, open-source, local-first Markdown editor built with [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/).

* Works directly with your **local** files, entirely **offline**.
* Write your notes in **Markdown**, with **syntax extensions** like citations and block directives. 
* Build your own personal wiki with **bidirectional links**.
* Excellent **math** support â€” seamlessly transition between source and rendered math, thanks to [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) and [prosemirror-math](https://github.com/benrbray/prosemirror-math).

## Feature Comparison

### Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (especially its community plugins) has been a source of inspiration for me during the development of Noteworthy, and occupies a similar position in the note-taking space, but with a few key differences:

* Noteworthy aims to be **fully open source**, so that the editor is fully customizable beyond what is possible with community plugins alone.  By contrast, the kernel of Obsidian is closed-source, making it more difficult for empassioned users to add the features they need.
* Noteworthy is WYSIWYG-first (based on [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/)), while Obsidian began as a split-pane editor and only introduced WYSIWYG-mode later (based on [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/)).
* Taking inspiration from [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/), Noteworthy aims to provide first-class support for **bibliography** management and academic citations.
* Noteworthy aims to provide a smooth, polished experience for math-heavy and diagram-heavy notetaking.
* Noteworthy will allow the user to mix-and-match different Markdown syntax extensions per-file via `flavor` metadata, to maximize **interoperability** with other editors.

```

After building, look in the `/dist` folder for an executable.

## Acknowledgements

* Thanks to [Marijn Haverbeke](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/) for developing [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/)!
* Thanks to [Hendrik Erz](https://github.com/nathanlesage) for keeping [Zettlr](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr) open source!  When I started developing Noteworthy, I had no clue how to set up an Electron app or responsibly interact with the user's file system from Node, and the Zettlr source was a great reference.
* Thanks to Microsoft for keeping [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) open source!  I learned a lot by reading the source of the VS Code tree viewer and plugin system.
* Thanks to [Fabio Spampinato](https://fabiospampinato.com/) for releasing the source to an early version [Notable](https://github.com/notable/notable)!
